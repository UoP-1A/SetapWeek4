1. How do you currently keep track of your prescription?
   - Currently, I call the GP about 3 weeks after getting medication asking for a new prescription over the phone. They call me back when it is ready and I go collect. With an extra 2-3 days after handing in the prescription. If you forget, they send it back if you don't collect. 
3. What challenges do you face with managing your medication?
   - Trying to remember when I have to renew my prescription. Not allowed to get more medication. Set a reminder in calendar to ask for a new prescription. Takes 7 days after asking to get the medication because of the     process and availability. Leading to have to give lieua to get medication.
4. What accessibility features are a deal-breaker for you to use this app?
   - Large fonts (but not too large).
5. How important is it for your family or caregivers to have access to your medication schedule, and what features would facilitate that?
   - One person to be able to collect medication but provide approval every time rather than a constant approval to collect on their behalf.  
6. What concerns would you have regarding the use, and processing, of your medical data
   - Require manual approval from the client regarding who can retrieve data and prescriptions.
7. Would you find value in finding educational resources in the app?
   - Yes, about what happens if you miss a dose or take too much medicine. Can I drive? etc.
